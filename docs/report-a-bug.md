# Report a bug

**OS Time Tracking** is an open-source project driven by a community. If you don't feel ready to contribute code to the project, reporting bugs and discuss feature ideas can be a great start to get involved and give back. **You don't need to be an expert to contribute!**

## Be constructive
Before you begin, remember that you are looking at the result of someone else's hard work. A good review or comment thanks the contributor to their work and identifies what was done well and what can be improved.

## Please take note of our roadmap
We plan releases in order to release stable new versions as efficiently as possible. This way the software is more useful and we regularly make users happy when useful and time-saving functions are made available.  
The Roadmap gives you an overview of the upcoming features and the Issue Board is used to plan and manage current tasks. Please create an issue for all ideas, bugs, questions and tips.

## Read the Symfony docs
OS Time Tracking is based on the Symfony PHP framework. We did not develop the framework. Please read the documentation if you need help with Symfomy specific problems. If the problem still exists, please create a bug report on the Issue Board.
